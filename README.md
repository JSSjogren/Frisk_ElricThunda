# MCMProject_Frisk
Project completed for ElricThunda on MC-Market

1. Right-click a player to confiscate contraband (Can be edited in config.yml).
2. Confiscated contraband is moved to guard's inventory so that it's droppable.
3. Guard can only frisk prisoners once every 20 seconds (If within 20 seconds, will deduct 2 hearts).
4. Guards have 40 health (2 rows of 10 hearts).
5. When guards die, non-contraband items do not drop.
6. [Tentative] Ability to jail players for configurable period of time

Permissions:
  * frisk.health - Gives players 40 health on re-join
  * frisk.bypass - Bypass 20 second cooldown for frisking
  * frisk.frisk - Gives player ability to frisk prisoners

Commands:
  * None at the moment
